    "_\"Mathematics may not be ready for such problems\"_ - Paul Erd≈ës on the Collatz conjecture.\n",

    "It has long been known that the following identity applies to all paths of the Collatz sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "$2^{e}x_{n} - 3^{o}x_{0} = k$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x_{0}$ is the initial term and $x_{n}$ is the final term and $e$, $o$ and $k$ are path dependent parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper derives a formula for k derived from 3 parameter sequences $m_{n}, o_{n}, e_{n}$.\n",

    "\n",
    "The resultant identity is not novel, for example see \\[1\\], but perhaps the technique by which it was derived may be interesting to some.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also derive a recurrence relation that expresses each $k_{n}$ in terms of $k_{n-1}$\n",
